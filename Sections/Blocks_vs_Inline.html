    <h1>Blocks vs Inline elemets</h1>
    <p>
        Each element in HTML is considered either a block element or an inline element.<br>
        For example a paragarph <b>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</b> tags are a block element, while the anchor tag <b>&lt;a&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;</b>
        is not.<br>
        The difference is how they are ordered on the page, blocks elements take the whole horizontal space, while
        inline elements grouped
        together in one line. <br>
        Here is an example for: <br><br>
        This is a paragarph
    <p>We can see it takes the whole row</p>
    Here are two anchors <a href="Som">Some link</a> <a href="Som">Some link 2</a> we can see how both of them are in
    the same line.<br>

    This behavior can be changed using CSS
    </p>

    A good example for a block element is the div tag <b>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</b> it groups elements in the same
    block,
    it is mostly useful when combined with CSS.<br>
    An inline version for div is span, its tags are - <b>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</b>
    For more information on Div and Span check this <a href="div_n_span.html">link</a>
    <br>Reminder to myself - Update this section when I know CSS
