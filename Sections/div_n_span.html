    <h1>Div and Span elements</h1>
    <p>
        Div and Span are two generic container elements, we can group elements together in them, and apply different CSS
        designs on them to give our web-app a little more flavor.<br>
        Both of them have a class property to know which css to access and applies the visuals.

    <h2>Div</h2>
    <p>
        The tag for div is <b>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</b>
        Div element is a block element, all the items grouped in it will take one row block in the page.
    </p>
    <h2>Span</h2>
    <p>
        The tag for span is <b>&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</b>
        Span element is an inline element, all the items grouped in it will be in the same row with other elements, in
        the page.
